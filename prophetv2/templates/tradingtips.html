                                    <h5>In the investing world, the terms "bull" and "bear" are frequently used to refer to market conditions</h5>

                                        <li class ="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Patterns and trends in major stock market indexes are often described in bullish vs. bearish terms. And as an investor, the direction of the market is a major force that has a huge impact on your portfolio</li>
                                        <li class ="list-group-item list-group-item-info">In a bull market, there is strong demand and weak supply for securities. This leads to more investors wising to buy as compared to selling the stock. Therefore this will result in the stock price going up due to the demand. In the bear market the opposite happens. As more are looking to sell the buy. Which results in the price of the stock to drop.</li>
                                        <li class ="list-group-item list-group-item-info">In a bull market, an investor would normally take advantage of the rising price and buy stocks as early as possible so that he/she can sell it off once it had reached a peak according to the investor. During the bull market, any losses should be minor and temporary; an investor can typically actively and confidently invest in more equity with a higher probability of making a return. In a bear market, however, the chance of losses is greater because prices are continually losing value and the end is often not in sight. Therefore it's advised to not invest in such a situation and wait for a sign of a bullish market.</li>
                                        <li class ="list-group-item list-group-item-info">In a Bear market there is a weak demand for a stock and plentiful supply which lowers stock value. 
                                            This causes a snowball effect of selling, affecting the stock value further.</li>
                                        <li class ="list-group-item list-group-item-info">When the market is bearish, it is more likely to make a loss due to a dip in prices and the end is often not in sight. Therefore it's advised to be more prudent with your investments and wait for a bullish market.</li>
